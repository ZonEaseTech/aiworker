# AIWorker Changelog

## 2026-04-20 17:15 [progress]

Phase 3 + 4 complete. Backend gained `execution`, `config`, `events` modules (REST + SSE). Web app scaffolded with Vite 8 + TanStack Router/Query + Tailwind v4 + Base UI primitives, and all six pages implemented: Dashboard (live SSE feed + service status), Skills (list/diff/conflicts tabs with sync trigger), Memory Explorer (search + filters + new), Execution Monitor (stats, filters, live tool feed, paginated table), Config Editor (read/write Hermes YAML + OpenClaw JSON with backup), Sync Status (timeline + run sync). Drizzle migrations auto-applied on `initDb`. Vite proxy now respects `AIWORKER_API_URL`. `bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint` clean across all workspaces.
